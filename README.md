# Movie Recommendation System

## Internship Task
This project is completed as **Task 2** of the **Data Science Internship at Interncred**.

## Problem Statement
Build a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies
based on similarity in genres, keywords, and movie descriptions.

## Dataset
TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset from Kaggle.

## Approach
- Selected relevant features (overview, genres, keywords)
- Cleaned and processed text data
- Converted text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
- Calculated similarity using cosine similarity
- Recommended top similar movies based on content

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Output
The system successfully recommends movies similar to a given movie title.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how content-based recommender systems work
using text similarity techniques.
